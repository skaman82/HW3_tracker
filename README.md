# Hello Watch UI bug status tracker
Here I want to list all current issues of the watch at current development stages. Main focus is UI and functionallity of the watch. While smoothness is an overall isue I leave this aside, since functionality has higher priority.

LIST UPDATE STATE: FW 1.00.40

## General/Menu/Watchfaces
<img src="https://github.com/skaman82/HW3_tracker/blob/main/10040/1.jpg)"/>

• UI: current watchfaces seem to have a lower resolution than the watch display. 
This resulting in blown up and blurry graphics - same goes for the honeycomb menu.

• UI: In the main menu the rainbow icon opens "sport stats" instead of "step summary". 
This is not logical as the icon represents the rainbow circle of the "steps stats screen".

• Function: "Raise to wake" doesnt work on my watch

• Weather don't show up on the dashboard (when you swipe right on the watch face) only cloud icon

• Function: Sometimes charging screen remains on even when the charger is remooved

• Menu list view: add some more space between the icon and text<br>

• Not a bug but but a suggestion: I would love if an interactive watch face style could be locked (now it is still changes style/colors on tap)


## Notifications
• swiping back from the message detail view shows black screen (when you have a couple messages)<br>
• Notifications overflow: to many not usefull notifications normall not diesplayed by other watches like "tweet send" or "xx new messages" from whattsapp

## Custom watchfaces
• Function: please also add pointer dial style to make it perfect

## Allways on display
• UI: Digital style of AOD is very simple and could have a nicer font and maybe additional info like steps or battery status

## Beadside clock
• Currently missng: Please add and make sure it is constant on with low light intensity while charging.

## Sports (very brief tested so there may be more)
• UI: Lock/Add buttons during an activity have no function<br>
• UI: END Activity button has a PAUSE icon - not logical<br>
<i>• rest to be tested</i>

## Sport record
• UI: Icon makes no sense as it is showing "Step rainbow"<br>
<i>• rest to be tested</i>

## Heart Rate
• UI: Missing space: 80bpm 0Minutes ago (space between "0" and "Minutes")<br>
• UI: Missing space and typo in "Resting heartrate" and in "Waling heartrate": 80bpm 0Minutes *Agogo* (space between "0" and "Minutes"  and "ago")<br>

## SPO
• UI: Result screen doesnt look good

## Step
• Function: Step count not working on my watch (always showing 0 steps)<br>
• UI: Wrong icon in distance stats section (blue) - currently showing green steps icon <br>

## Compass
• Function: SNot working on my watch yet - compass only mooving a few degrees it i rotate the watch<br>
• UI: switching between the two compass modes not allways work (tapping on the list icon)

## Sleep
• Function & Stats: Not working on my watch yet <br>
• UI: "All timing" Screen not working / not configurable<br>
• UI: "add other timing" screen not working / not configurable<br>
• UI: "Sleep goal" button looks not aligned and has no function<br>

## Dial
• UI: "+" takes you to contact list instead of typing "+" (icon either should be changed or the functionallity)

## Call record
• UI: Call records dissapearing sometimes once viewed - mannually deleting them would be better<br>

## Contacts
• UI: Not enough spacing between profile icon and name<br>

## Calender
• UI: 1st weekday is currently Sunday - thats not the case in europe and should be at least configurable <br>

## Weather
• UI: Forecast not readable (maybee add an dark gradient in the background or redesign)<br>
• UI: animated wave has no function and can be remooved <br>
• UI: scrolling reveals black borders, while swiping left, forecast elements overflow<br>
• Function: weather not accurtate for my location (16 vs 19 deg)<br>
• UI: Weather data not showing up on the dashboard in the watchface (only cloud icon - see above)<br>

## Music
• UI: Track name is not displayed properly while in media control mode (only first track gets updated)<br>
• UI: Play/Pause button has no state change (should be displayed as pause while music is playing)<br>
• UI: no visual fidback on volume change<br>
• UI: loop icon has no functionality<br>
• UI: local music screen (please sync on your App) has a misplace small music icon on the screen<br>

• Function: BT earbud connection doesn't work<br>

## Position

## Breath training
• UI: animation is stuttery (not a priority tho) 

## Alarms
• Function: sound alarm missing even when "ring" is set<br>
• UI: text is not vertically centered and changes style (active/not active)<br>
• UI: when setting additional alarm and activating it the bell icon is overlapping text

• UI: When timer is finished UI looks stange

## Photo album
• Function: Deleting a photo doesn't work
• UI: Delete button labell is not scrolling and is cut off
