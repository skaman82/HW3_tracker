# Hello Watch UI bug status tracker
Here I want to list all current issues of the watch at current development stages. Main focus is UI and functionallity of the watch. While smoothness is an overall isue I leave this aside, since functionality has higher priority.

LIST UPDATE STATE: FW 1.00.40

## General/Menu/Watchfaces
• UI: current watchfaces seem to have a lower resolution than the watch display. 
This resulting in blown up and blurry graphics - same goes for the honeycomb menu.

• UI: In the main menu the rainbow icon opens "sport stats" instead of "step summary". 
This is not logical as the icon represents the rainbow circle of the "steps stats screen".

## Custom watchfaces
• Function: please add pointer dial style

## Allways on display
• UI: Digital style of AOD is very simple and could have a nicer font and maybe additional info like steps or battery status


## Sports (very brief tested so there may be more)
• UI: Lock/Add buttons during an activity have no function<br>
• UI: END Activity button has a PAUSE icon - not logical<br>
<i>• rest to be tested</i>

## Sport record
• UI: Icon makes no sense as it is showing "Step rainbow"<br>
<i>• rest to be tested</i>
