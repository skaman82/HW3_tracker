# Hello Watch 3 UI bug/functions status tracker
Here I want to list all current issues of the watch at current development stages. Main focus is UI and functionallity of the watch core functions. While smoothness is an overall an issue, I leave this aside, since the rest has a much higher priority.


REMARK: My step counter and "raise to wake" functions never worked since I got the watch. There are some people reporting steps
or rase to wake functions working - some even both. Regarding this I'm not sure if this is falty hardware and bad quality control or something else.


<b>LIST UPDATE STATE: FW 1.00.41</b>

## General/Menu/Watchfaces
• UI: current watchfaces seem to have a lower resolution than the watch display. 
This resulting in blown up and blurry graphics - same goes for the honeycomb menu.<br>

• Function issue: Watch doesn't stop vibrationg when I take a call on my Phone<br>

• Function issue: Volume control is not linked to phones volume (even if there is the setting "Media tone control"). When volume on the phone is turned down, increasing the volume on the watch has not much effect<br>

• UI: In the main menu the rainbow icon opens "sport stats" instead of "step summary". 
This is not logical as the icon represents the rainbow circle of the "steps stats screen".<br>

• Function issue: "Raise to wake" doesnt work on my watch<br>
<img src="https://github.com/skaman82/HW3_tracker/blob/main/10040/3.jpg" width="300px"/>

• Weather don't show up on the side dashboard (when you swipe right on the watch face) only cloud icon with a question mark<br>

• Function issue: Sometimes charging screen remains on, even when the charger is remooved<br>

• Not a bug, but but a suggestion: I would love if an interactive watch face style could be locked (now it is still changes style/colors on tap)<br>

## Notifications
• <del>swiping back from the message detail view shows black screen (when you have a couple messages)</del> fixed in 1.00.41<br>
<img src="https://github.com/skaman82/HW3_tracker/blob/main/10040/6.jpg" width="300px"/>

• Notifications overflow: too many not usefull notifications normally not displayed by other watches like "tweet send" or "xx new messages" from whattsapp<br>
• UI: "WhatAapp message summary" message has a corrupted message count when the number is higher then 9 (see photo). But the whole message is unnecessary<br>
• UI: Not all selectable notifications from the app list have a dedicated icon, WhattsApp, Facebook, Instagramm do. But Telegram for example has a generic icon<br>
